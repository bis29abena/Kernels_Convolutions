# Kernels_Convolutions
Built my own custom convolution functions which explictly shows how convolution
works with kernels and images 

I compared my custom convolution with Opencv's filer2D to compare if what i was doing was correct

we apply kernels for blurring, smothening, edge detections and sharpening of images

Usage python main.py --image imageFile(path to input image)
